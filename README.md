# AB Proce Over Spot
This browser extension is for [ainsliebullion.com.au]. It finds product listings on their site and updates the UI to display the percentage above the market spot price they are selling the bullion for. This is often referred to as the `premium`.

## Limitations
- The extension does not update the modified content after a given time. You will need to refresh the page for that.
- The percentage is not displayed on a products details page, only pages displaying lists of products.

## Bugs
- There is a issue causing the percentage to be calculated incorrectly when you back navigate. This does *NOT* come from the extension, but from the Ainslie Bullion website itself. You will need to refresh the page if you back navigate.
